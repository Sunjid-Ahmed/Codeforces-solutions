# üöÄ Codeforces Solutions

Welcome to the **Codeforces Solutions** repository!  
This repository contains my personal solutions to a variety of algorithmic and competitive programming problems from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).

---

## üìö About

This repository serves as a collection of well-organized and consistently formatted solutions to problems I‚Äôve solved on Codeforces.  
It reflects my journey in improving problem-solving skills and preparing for competitive programming contests.

---

## üìÇ Structure

The solutions are grouped by contest or problem set, and organized as follows:

```

Codeforces-solutions/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Contest-1234/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ A.cpp
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ B.cpp
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Div2-789/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ A.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ B.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ C.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

```

Each file is named according to its problem code and contains:
- A problem statement link as a comment
- My full source code solution
- Comments where applicable to explain logic
